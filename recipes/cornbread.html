        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This hot water cornbread is a very old-fashioned recipe. The cornbread is shaped into little cakes and fried rather than baked. Serve the cakes warm with maple syrup or honey.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup cornmeal</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon white sugar</li>
            <li>Â¾ cup boiling water</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon bacon grease</li>
            <li>1 cup bacon grease, or as needed</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
            <li>Combine cornmeal, salt, and sugar in a medium bowl. Add boiling water and 1 tablespoon bacon grease; stir until bacon grease melts.</li>
            <li>Pour bacon grease to a depth of 1/2-inch in a large skillet; heat to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>

            <li>Fry, turning once, in hot oil until crisp and golden brown, about 5 minutes. Drain on paper towels and serve warm.</li>
